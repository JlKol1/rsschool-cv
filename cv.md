#### ***ABOUT ME:***
***THIS IS MY START***.
I never thought about programming; moreover, I ignored IT lessons at school.
I have been working since I was 18. My job was a means of earning money for what I loved - cycling, which I wanted to make my job, my main activity - but I was blocked from getting there.
And I decided that I needed to arrange my life. Now this has become my priority and I have chosen the direction of IT.


I will not sing odes to programming. Yes, this is a choice not with the heart, but with the mind. I study because my goal is a decent job, a high salary, the opportunity to constantly develop (after all, this is an area in which you need to constantly learn, and study = development). I like it and I want to constantly move forward, learn new things, strive upward. All this I found in programming. I tried and realized that I like writing code, improving it, looking for the best solutions to the problem posed to me. Iâ€™m sure when I learn to be a programmer, I will love writing code and the union of choice with the mind and falling in love with it will make me the best version of myself every day.

#### ***SKILLS:***
Now I know the basic skills of HTML, CSS, JS.
I can make a page and apply styles and scripts to it. At code wars my level is 6KU and you have no idea how I like working with arrays!

I learned how to write a calculator, maybe I will have time to master the keyboard before the course? If I could, I will definitely write about it below!
